Create me an application that generates a random soulframe loadout based on randomizer.json.

There should be 4 sections.

Pact
Armor Set
Primary Weapon
Secondary Weapon

Each of these sections should have a reroll button that rerolls that particular section when clicked. The reroll button should have a fixed position and not move when the text size in each section changes.

Use the app in ExampleApp as an example of how to style the application, as well as an example of the reroll buttons. The style should be a dark theme with green text, just like the example app.
The app should have reroll buttons that look and behave like the exampleApp.
